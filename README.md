# 42-Curcus
The codes of the projects I did in 42.

**libft** -> The aim of this project is to write a C library. It will contain a lot of general purpose functions and functions that your programs can be based on. \
**get_next_line** -> The aim of the project is to develop a function that allows you to read the text file referenced by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
